# Alt-Tab Navigation with RMB + Scroll (AutoHotkey)

## ðŸš€ Overview
This AutoHotkey (AHK) script enhances **Alt-Tab window switching** by allowing users to **hold the right mouse button (RMB) and scroll** to navigate through open windows.

### ðŸ”¹ Features:
- **Hold RMB + Scroll Up** â†’ Move **backward** in Alt-Tab  
- **Hold RMB + Scroll Down** â†’ Move **forward** in Alt-Tab  
- **Releasing RMB** â†’ Confirms selection in Alt-Tab  
- **Normal right-click** works if no scrolling occurs  
- **Additional mouse functions restore missing behavior**  
- **Compiled EXE version available for users without AHK installed**

## ðŸ“œ Script Usage
### **ðŸŽ¯ How It Works**
1. **Right-click (`RButton`) and hold**
2. **Scroll up (`WheelUp`)** â†’ Move backward in Alt-Tab
3. **Scroll down (`WheelDown`)** â†’ Move forward in Alt-Tab
4. **Release right-click (`RButton Up`)** â†’ Confirms selection

## ðŸ”§ Additional Mouse Functions (Why They're Needed)
By default, using **AutoHotkey to override `RButton`** can interfere with certain native right-click functionalities. This script includes additional hotkeys to ensure those functions **work as expected**.

| Hotkey | Action | Why It's Included? |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| **Shift + Right Click** | Opens full context menu | Some apps have extra options when Shift is held |
| **Ctrl + Right Click** | Ctrl + RMB function | Ensures normal Ctrl + RMB behavior remains intact |
| **Alt + Right Click** | Alt + RMB function | Prevents interference with Alt + RMB hotkeys |

This ensures that **default Windows behaviors are not lost** while using this script.
